# F-PHP
A mini-CTF website with focus on some PHP vulnerabilities.

FPHP is a new project that promotes learning some PHP best practices in order to learn about common online vulnerabilities and how to guard against them.

It combines vulnerabilities into challenges in which you must exploit the vulnerability in order to locate a "flag" that indicates that you have correctly identified the malfunction.

 #### Implemented challenges:
 - IDOR: Insecure direct object reference.
 - RCE: Remote code execution.
 - Jail Escape functions.
 - SQL injection.
