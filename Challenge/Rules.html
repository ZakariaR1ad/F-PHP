                1. No Flag Sharing or (Direct) Outside Help. Using any resource that can be found on the web is fair play, but you may not ask anyone outside of your team and the admins for assistance. This includes, but is not limited to the sharing of flags, hints, methodology, or other problem aids.<br/><br/>

                2. Only attack platforms that are designated as targets. Any attack on infrastructure or other participants will not be tolerated. This includes:
                    - DoS attacks
                    - Modifying or deleting flags
                    - Attacking the servers and/or messing with servers via shell access
                    - Deliberately hindering other teams
                All attackable services will be clearly marked. We are not responsible for unauthorized attacks, and breaking this rule is grounds for disqualification.
                <br/><br/>
                3. If you have questions or technical issues, send a DM to OctaC0re members to initiate a conversation with an Admin. (Also, if you are struggling with a challenge, do not hesitate to ask for hints! It is a learning CTF )
